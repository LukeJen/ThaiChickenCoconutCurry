To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and saut√© over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; stir intermittently.
Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.
Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir frequently.
Add the coconut milk, carrots, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 5 minutes, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly.
Add the spinach, lime juice, and stir to combine. Cook until spinach has wilted and is tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and optionally add brown sugar, additional curry paste, salt, pepper, etc. to taste.

Evenly sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Curry is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week.
